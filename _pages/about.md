ü§ñResearch
======
(1) **Learning Analytics (LA)**

Building a smart learning environment named GOAL system that can promote students' self-directed learning using Learning Analytics. The system automatically collects students' learning log data from e-book materials and physical activity data such as sleep and steps taken from wearable devices, visualizes students' activity status, supports personal planning, and provides reflection feedback through AI and dashboards. 

(2) **Educational Data Mining (EDM)**

Measuring and improving self-regulated learning skills from learning behavior data using Educational Data Mining. Developing an effective AI feedback system by identifying self-regulated learning strategies from multimodal data including learning record (log data), eye tracking, electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram (EEG). 

(3) **Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED)** 

Research on education-specific LLM agents. Developing a multi-AI agent system called MetaStep to enhance students' metacognitive skills in programming education, aiming to achieve personalized learning support.
